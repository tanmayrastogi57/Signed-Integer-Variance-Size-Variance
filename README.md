# Variable Size and Ranges in C++

## Description

This repository aims to provide an in-depth understanding of why variable sizes in C++ can differ across different systems and compilers, and to explain the default range of signed integers. Through code examples and detailed documentation, this repository explores the underlying principles and standards that influence these aspects of C++.

## Introduction

C++ is a versatile programming language used across various platforms. One of its intriguing aspects is that the size of its fundamental data types can vary between different systems and compilers. This repository provides an in-depth look at these variations and explains why signed integers have the default range of -32767 to 32767.

## Why Variable Sizes Differ

The size of fundamental data types in C++ can vary based on several factors:
- **Compiler Implementations**: Different compilers may implement data types differently to optimize performance and memory usage.
- **System Architecture**: 32-bit vs 64-bit systems can have different data type sizes.
- **Standards and Conventions**: Historical and practical reasons for choosing certain sizes. The C++ standard only specifies minimum sizes, allowing flexibility.

## Signed Integer Range

The C++ standard guarantees that the range for a signed `int` must be at least -32767 to 32767. This range is based on:
- **Minimum 16-bit Representation**: A signed `int` must be at least 16 bits.
- **Two's Complement Representation**: Most systems use two's complement for representing signed integers, where the range for a 16-bit signed integer is -32768 to 32767. To ensure portability and consistency, the C++ standard specifies a minimum range of -32767 to 32767.

## Examples

The `src` directory contains code examples demonstrating different aspects of variable sizes and ranges in C++:

- **size_of_types.cpp**: Check the sizes of various data types in C++.
- **signed_int_range.cpp**: Check the range of signed integers using limits defined in the C++ standard library.
- **platform_specific.cpp**: Determine the sizes of data types on different platforms.

### size_of_types.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " byte" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of short: " << sizeof(short) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of long: " << sizeof(long) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of long long: " << sizeof(long long) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### signed_int_range.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Minimum value of signed int: " << INT_MIN << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Maximum value of signed int: " << INT_MAX << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### platform_specific.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
#ifdef _WIN32
    std::cout << "Running on Windows" << std::endl;
#elif __APPLE__
    std::cout << "Running on macOS" << std::endl;
#elif __linux__
    std::cout << "Running on Linux" << std::endl;
#else
    std::cout << "Unknown platform" << std::endl;
#endif

    std::cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of long: " << sizeof(long) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of long long: " << sizeof(long long) << " bytes" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## How to Run the Examples

To compile and run the examples, use the following commands based on your platform:

**Windows (using MSVC)**
```bash
cl size_of_types.cpp
size_of_types.exe
```

**macOS (using Clang)**
```bash
clang++ size_of_types.cpp -o size_of_types
./size_of_types
```

**Linux (using GCC)**
```bash
g++ size_of_types.cpp -o size_of_types
./size_of_types
```
